Pipeline Using Both RP2040 Cores 
Note: 
Both cores (ARM Cortex-M0+) are symmetric in performance and functionality on the RP Pico.
Core 0 starts by default. Core 1 needs to be started by Core 0.

Core 0:

- Handles data acquisition (SPI)
- Performs clustering (e.g., DBSCAN) per frame
- Estimates cluster centroids (x, y)
- Writes cluster info to a shared buffer

Core 1:

- Monitors shared cluster data
- Checks for a valid cluster near the user-provided target position
- Applies noise filtering (e.g., sliding window, range thresholding)
- If a valid match is found, transitions to tracking mode
- Tracks that cluster in subsequent frames
